K-means clustering is an important unsupervised learning method. It is the technique of classifying data using a certain set of clusters which is called K clusters. It is deployed for grouping to find out the similarity in the data.






Explain the difference between Data Science and Data Analytics?
Data Scientists need to slice data to extract valuable insights that a data analyst can apply to real-world business scenarios. The main difference between the two is that the data scientists have more technical knowledge then business analyst. Moreover, they don’t need an understanding of the business required for data visualization.
